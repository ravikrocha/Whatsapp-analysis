# Whatsapp-analysis
Data cleaning for further exploratory analysis of a whatsapp group I'm joined to learn English, so everyone should speaks only in English. My goal was to did some sentiment analysis and try to find some correlation between people leaving of the group and the number of negative messages using sentiment analysis algorithms
First I cleaned all the data using regex and I organized into tables: message, ban users, people left, origin of the message, etc. 
Afterwards, I used sentiment analysis algorithms to classify messages in positive and negative ones.
In the end I did some visualizations from Tableau software to see if I was right or wrong with my first intuitions.
